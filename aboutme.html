       <h1> About me</h1>
       <p> My name is Colin Gallagher and I'm a sophmore at here at URI, majoring in Computer Science. I'm from Warwick, Rhode Island and graduated from Pilgrim High School. I've always had an interest in computers, but I haven't spent a lot of time focusing on coding, so that's why I chose CS as a major.</p>
         <p> Outside of school, my hobbies consist of fishing, listening to music, watching sports, and playing games with my friends. My favorite sports to watch are football and MMA. In highschool, I ran track and field, and played rugby. I started with rugby at Bishop Hendricken, then I transfered to Pilgrim my senior year and helped create their own rugby team.
